## Description

_Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay. Rules:_
1. _For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added. Example: "pig" = "igpay"_
2. _When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing. Example: "smile" = "ilesmay"_
3. _For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" to the end (or just "ay"). Example: "eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"_
4. _For words which starts with "qu",move the "u" along with the "q" and add "ay" at the end. Example: "quiet" = "ietquay"._
5. _For words which starts with consonants and include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q" and add "ay" at the end. Example: "squirrel" = "irrelsquay"._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
