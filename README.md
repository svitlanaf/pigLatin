## Description

_Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay. Rules:_
1. _For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added. Example: "pig" = "igpay"_
2. _When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing. Example: "smile" = "ilesmay"_
3. _For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Example: "eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"_
4. _An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable. Example: "every" = "eryevay"._
